// State True or False

// (Q1) A function may be called more than once from any other function.

// Ans : True: We can call as many times a function as we want.

// (Q2) It is necessary for a function to return a value

// Ans : False: A function can have a void return type, which means return nothing.

// (Q7) Can the same function name be used for different functions without any conflict?

// Ans - The same function name can be used for different functions without any conflict if
// and only if they either have different data types for arguments or different number
// of arguments. Same function names cannot be used if functions differ only by their
// return type because the compiler would not then know which function is to be used.
